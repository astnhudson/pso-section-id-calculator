# PSO-Section-ID-Calculator
Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II uses a system to define what items you are more likely, or less likely, to encounter.
In fact, some items will never appear unless your character belongs to a specific group! This group is based on your in-game name, and in the case of
Blue Burst, also your chosen class.
This system is known as the **Section ID** system.

The PSO Section ID Calculator is an easy-to-use application which enables you to input a desired name and output the generated Section ID.
Features:
- Lightweight command-line application - no install required!
- All character support so even foreign alphabets and special characters can be used. ‚ù§ is a Purplenum!

# How to use
1. [Download the latest .exe for **Windows** here.](https://github.com/astnhudson/pso-section-id-calculator/releases "PSO Section ID Calculator")
2. Double click the .exe to run.
3. Follow the application prompts.
4. Finish by closing the application, or by typing "exit" when prompted.

# A Little Bit About Section IDs
Section IDs fall into 10 categories. They are:
 * 0 - Viridia
 * 1 - Greenill
 * 2 - Skyly
 * 3 - Bluefull
 * 4 - Purplenum
 * 5 - Pinkal
 * 6 - Redria
 * 7 - Oran
 * 8 - Yellowboze
 * 9 - Whitill

When creating a character, the name you choose is converted and reduced down to a single digit, and that digit from 0-9 will 
determine your section ID. For example, the name **DarkFalz** will be converted to 3 and give the character a **Bluefull** section ID. Even changing the case
of a letter will affect the result. Compare **Blueberry** (0, Viridia) with **blueberry** (2, Skyly).
Section IDs are unchangeable, so it is helpful to know what your character's potential is before you commit 200 hours to the game.

Different Section IDs are better suited for some classes and playstyles than others. 
 * **Viridia** will most often find shot type weapons. Useful for Rangers.
 * **Greenill** will most often find rifle type weapons. Useful for Rangers.
 * **Skyly** will most often find sword type weapons. Useful for Hunters.
 * **Bluefull** will most often find partisan type weapons. This ID has more drawbacks than benefits, so consider finding a different section ID.
 * **Purplenum** will most often find mechgun type weapons. Useful for Rangers.
 * **Pinkal** will most often find wand type weapons. Useful for Forces.
 * **Redria** will most often find slicer type weapons, however there is a general balance for all other weapon types. Useful for all classes.
 * **Oran** will most often find dagger type weapons. Useful for Hunters.
 * **Yellowboze** will most often find animal parts. All-around useful, but consider finding a more specialized section ID.
 * **Whitill** will most often find slicer type weapons. Useful for Rangers due to the restriction of some items being found only with this ID.
